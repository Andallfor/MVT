        {"Mercury", "Only a touch smaller than our own moon, Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the first planet in our solar system. Because of its very dense atmosphere, it can repel some of the Sun's radiation and thus is not the hottest planet in our solar system."},
        {"Venus", "With a thick atmosphere of greenhouse gasses, Venus retains much heat, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System. While both Venus and Earth appoximately share the same mass and desnity, Venus spins in the opposite direction of Earth and many other planets in our Solar System."},
        {"Earth", "The planet Earth has been a beacon for humanity for thousands of years, and this is the launching point for the Artemis Missions."},
        {"Mars", "It is theorized that many billions of years ago Mars had an atmosphere, a warmer climate and water on its surface. While Mars does not have any discovered biological life, it is full of robotic life."},
        {"Jupiter", "Twice the size of any other planet in the Solar System, Jupiter is a gas giant with a cold atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Larger than the earth, the Great Red Spot swirls on its surface, a raging storm of ammonia and water clouds."},
        {"Saturn", "Saturn, famous for its dazzling rings of ice and rock, is a gas giant mostly consiting of hydrogen and helium. We humans have left our footprint on Saturn as two tons of mass was contributed to the planet by the Casini Spacecraft."},
        {"Uranus", "Looking up at the night sky through a telescope William Herschel spotted Uranus, another gas giant. Uranus rotates on its side, a 90 degree tilt from what was perviously expected, and his rings."},
        {"Neptune", "First discovered by mathematical calulations, the farthest planet in our Solar System (sorry Pluto) is Neptune. Because of its massive distance from the sun, Neptune is a dark and cold planet battered by supersonice winds on its surface."},


        {"Luna", "The moon is a natural satelite of Earth, about 239,000 miles from Earth on avg. Famous for controlling tides, the moon was formed after a collision between Earth and a planet known as Theia.  Humans have explored the moon via the Apollo Era Missions, however this is soon to change with the planned Artemis Missions."},

        {"CubeSat-1", "This cubesat is part of a class of nano-satelites known as a cubesat used to explore space in a smaller and less expensive formfactor. This particular satelite is testing a potential Artemis orbit."},
