# MVT
The Mission Visualization Toolkit (MVT) is a novel piece of software that seeks to enable efficient and accurate lunar case studies, while being accessible to the general user to appeal to a wider audience.  
This season and project would not have been possible without the guidance and support of our mentor, George Bussey. We would also like to extend thanks to Elana Resnick, Jimmy Acevado, Korine Powers, Thomas Montano, Barbara Addey, and Ryan Welsh for their help in various departments over the course of this season. We would also like to thank the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and NASA's Space Communications and Navigation Program as a whole for making this opportunity possible for us.

This program was developed over the course of the 2022 SCaN Internship Project (SIP) internship season by Aman Garg, Aditya Dutt, Arya Kazemnia, Leo Wang, and Zoe Schoeneman-Fry.  
Minor parts of this program were derived from a previous, Earth focused build of MVT from the 2021 SIP internship season. Additional code was used with permission from Newtonsoft, NumSharp, ImageSharp, and HtmlAgilityPack.
