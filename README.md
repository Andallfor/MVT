# MVT
The Mission Visualization Toolkit (MVT) is a novel piece of software that seeks to enable efficient and accurate lunar case studies, while being accessible to the general user to appeal to a wider audience.  MVT is a lightweight web tool and application version of the Systems Toolkit (STK) expediting the testing of various “What-If” or hypothetical Lunar network scenarios, specifically the NASA Requirements Analysis Cycle (RAC) studies, impacting Artemis missions 3, 4, 5, and 8.
This season and project would not have been possible without the guidance and support of our mentors: George Bussey and Elana Resnick. We would also like to extend thanks to Jimmy Acevado, Korine Powers, Thomas Montano, Barbara Addey, and Ryan Welsh for their help in various departments over the course of this season. We would also like to thank the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and NASA's Space Communications and Navigation Program as a whole for making this opportunity possible for us.
